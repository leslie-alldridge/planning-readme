## Reflections & Learnings
- I enjoyed writing a ReadMe and refreshing myself on some of the markdown applications
- Users let me know they appreciated the clean format and concise information
- This readme didn't take long to write, but if I had planned better it would've resulted in less wasted time.
- I learned that markdown is a great language to learn and a cheatsheet for emoji exists here (https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)

## Next Action Steps
* I will practice emoji usage on github :whale:
* Writing ReadMe's consistently for my projects
* Better planning will lead to better success
